# Workspace benchmarks

Top-level benchmark infrastructure that doesn't naturally belong to a
single crate. Per-crate Criterion microbenchmarks (which track
sbol-rs's own internal performance over time) live in
`crates/sbol/benches/` instead. The distinction:

- `crates/sbol/benches/` → "is sbol-rs faster or slower than it was
  last week?" Run with `cargo bench -p sbol`.
- `benches/` (this directory) → "is sbol-rs faster or slower than the
  other SBOL 3 implementations?" Run with
  `cargo run --release -p sbol-bench`.

Suites here:

- [`cross-impl/`](cross-impl/README.md) — head-to-head performance
  comparison of sbol-rs against pySBOL3, libSBOLj3, and sboljs, each
  pinned in its own Docker image. Orchestrated by `crates/sbol-bench`.
