//! SBOL version conversion for the sbol-rs ecosystem.
//!
//! This crate converts between SBOL 2 and SBOL 3 at the RDF triple level.
//! [`upgrade_from_sbol2`] and friends read SBOL 2 RDF and build an
//! [`sbol3::Document`]; [`downgrade`] takes an [`sbol3::Document`] and emits
//! the equivalent SBOL 2 RDF graph, alongside a report of any non-fatal
//! issues encountered during conversion.
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
// Conversion errors carry the full context needed to diagnose a failed
// pipeline; boxing the large error arms would split that surface.
#![allow(clippy::result_large_err)]
