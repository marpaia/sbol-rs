//! Convert SBOL 3 documents to SBOL 2 RDF.
//!
//! Most published synbio content (SynBioHub, iGEM Registry, JBEI ICE
//! today) still consumes SBOL 2. This module is the write-direction
//! counterpart to [`crate::upgrade`]: it takes an SBOL 3
//! [`Document`](sbol3::Document) and produces an [`RdfGraph`] holding
//! the equivalent SBOL 2 RDF, which the caller can serialize in any
//! of the supported RDF formats.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use sbol3::Document;
//! use sbol3::RdfFormat;
//! use sbol_convert::downgrade;
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let document = Document::read_path("design.ttl")?;
//! let (sbol2_graph, report) = downgrade(&document)?;
//! for warning in report.warnings() {
//!     eprintln!("{warning:?}");
//! }
//! let sbol2_xml = sbol2_graph.write(RdfFormat::RdfXml)?;
//! std::fs::write("design.xml", sbol2_xml)?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Loss model
//!
//! SBOL 3 unifies several SBOL 2 concepts (notably `ComponentDefinition`
//! and `ModuleDefinition`) into a single `Component`. The downgrade is
//! therefore not strictly bijective; the [`DowngradeReport`] surfaces
//! warnings for cases where the SBOL 2 surface forces a representation
//! choice (unsupported SBOL 3-only types, MapsTo reconstruction from
//! `ComponentReference`+`Constraint` pairs, etc.).
//!
//! Documents produced via [`crate::upgrade::sbol2_to_sbol3`] round-trip
//! back to SBOL 2 through the version-in-IRI identity model and the
//! `https://sbols.org/backport/2_3#` hints the upgrade records.
//! Documents authored as native SBOL 3 will lose more on downgrade;
//! the report explains where.
//!
//! # Component classification
//!
//! Each SBOL 3 `Component` maps to exactly one SBOL 2 class: a
//! `ModuleDefinition` when it carries functional signals (interactions,
//! the FunctionalEntity type, or a subcomponent that is itself a
//! module-definition), otherwise a `ComponentDefinition`. A Component is
//! never split across both classes.
//!
//! For the full conversion model see the [conversion guide][conversion-md].
