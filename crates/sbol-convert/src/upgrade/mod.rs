//! Convert SBOL 2 RDF documents to SBOL 3.
//!
//! Most published synbio content (SynBioHub, iGEM Registry, JBEI ICE)
//! predates SBOL 3 and remains in SBOL 2 form. This module reads SBOL 2 RDF
//! and emits SBOL 3 RDF that can be loaded by the rest of the crate and
//! validated like any natively-authored SBOL 3 document.
//!
//! Conversion happens at the RDF triple level and matches the conversion
//! decisions of the SynBioDex/SBOL-Converter reference. No external runtime is
//! required: input goes in as bytes (any RDF serialization the [`RdfFormat`]
//! enum supports), output comes back as bytes plus an [`UpgradeReport`] of
//! warnings.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use sbol_convert::upgrade_from_sbol2_path;
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let (document, report) = upgrade_from_sbol2_path("design.xml")?;
//!
//! for warning in report.warnings() {
//!     eprintln!("{warning:?}");
//! }
//!
//! document.check()?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The [`Document`] is always returned when the input parses as valid SBOL 2
//! RDF. Callers gate on validation with the existing [`Document::check`]
//! method if they want a strict pipeline.
//!
//! For the full conversion model (workflows organized by what you have, the
//! `https://sbols.org/backport/2_3#` namespace, structural collapses
//! (SequenceAnnotation, MapsTo, Interface), known divergences, and known
//! limitations) see the [conversion guide][conversion-md].
